## JuliaZ
This is an interactive [Julia Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) visualization which allows changing the seed parameters as well as dynamically generating based on the mouse input coordinates. This used dat.gui for the interface, and all the drawing is done with basic HTML canvas methods.
